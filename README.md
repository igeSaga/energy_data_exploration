# Application for visually exploring energy data
The goal of this project is to develope an application for the visually exploring energy data. Energy data is represented by the electricity consumption of some 70 households in the [Suurstoffi](https://www.suurstoffi.ch/) district and was collected over 2.5 years (Spring 2013 to Autumn 2015) with a temporal resolution of 15min (appr. 35'000 measurements per household).
